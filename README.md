## Introduce
My goal is to build a fully functional `integrated interactive shell` tool for testing your websocket program.WS-CLI now include:
1. websocket client tool：Connect to a websocket server and test message sending.
2. websocket server tool：Run a websocket server and send message to client.

`Integrated interactive shell` dependent [grumble](https://github.com/desertbit/grumble) implementation. At present, the function is relatively simple, and relevant functions and capabilities will be continuously supplemented and improved in the future.
